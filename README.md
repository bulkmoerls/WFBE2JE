<em>aka: Worlds From Bedrock Edition To Java Edition</em>
</div>

## Description

This repo tries to convert Marketplace Worlds from Minecraft Bedrock Edition to Java. Due to any piracy means, this doesn't include worlds that cost Minecoins, and only include worlds that are actually free in the Marketplace.

## Why?

I don't know. I just feel like it. I want to revisit Bedrock Worlds in java because it's part of my childhood.

## What about credit?

I will, and it will be credited via folders.
